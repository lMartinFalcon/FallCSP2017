# To run a tournament, execute this file.

# Tournament results saved to tournament.txt in this directory.
#
# prisoners_dilemma.py automates competition among different strategies
# for the Iterative Prisoners Dilemma, the canonical game of game-theory.
# Each strategy is pitted against each other strategy for 100 to 200 rounds.
# The results of all previous rounds within a 100-200 round stretch are known
# to both players.

# play_tournament([team0, team1, team2]) executes a tournament and writes to tournament.txt

# Each team's strategy should be coded in their assigned Python file, called a module.
# Each player should have their own .py file containing 
# three strings team_name, strategy_name, and strategy_description
# and a function move(my_history, their_history, my_score, their_score)
# 
# By default, when executing this file, [example0, example1, example2, example3] 
# play a tournament. To run the tournament of [team, team1, team1, example1]:
